## Architecture Overview

This diagram illustrates the logical structure of the application and the flow of data between components. It clarifies responsibilities for each layer, how requests travel from the UI to persistence, and how responses are returned.

### Components

#### Frontend
- **Technologies:** React, Angular, Vue.js (example choices)
- **Role:** Responsible for user interface and client-side interaction. Sends API requests to the backend and renders received responses. Implements routing, state management, form validation, and responsive UI.

#### Backend
- **Technologies:** Node.js, Django, Spring Boot (example choices)
- **Role:** Hosts business logic, processes API requests, performs input validation and authentication/authorization, and coordinates with storage. Exposes endpoints consumed by the frontend.

#### APIs / Routes
- **Standards:** REST, GraphQL
- **Role:** Acts as the communication layer between frontend and backend services. Handles request routing, response formatting, pagination, error handling, and data shaping for clients.

#### Database / Storage
- **Technologies:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3 (example choices)
- **Role:** Persists structured and unstructured data. Provides secure read/write operations, indexing and queries for performant data retrieval, and object storage for large assets.

### Typical Data Flow
1. User interacts with the **Frontend** (UI) and triggers an action (e.g., form submit, data fetch).  
2. The frontend sends an **API request** (REST/GraphQL) to the **APIs / Routes** layer.  
3. The **Backend** receives the request, applies application logic (validation, business rules), and calls the **Database / Storage** as needed.  
4. The **Database / Storage** returns data; the backend shapes or transforms the response.  
5. The **APIs / Routes** deliver the response back to the **Frontend**, which renders the result to the user.

### Notes & Best Practices
- Use clear, consistent naming for endpoints and data models to avoid confusion in the codebase and diagram.  
- Secure all endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.  
- Consider caching strategies (CDN, Redis) for high-read endpoints to improve performance.  
- Separate concerns: keep UI logic in the frontend, business logic in the backend, and persistence concerns in the data layer.  
- Document any deviations from this model (microservices, serverless functions, event-driven flows) so contributors understand the real architecture.
