### **Font Weights Overview**

| Weight | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| **400 (Regular)** | Long paragraphs, general content, body text |
| **500 (Medium)** | Sub-headings, buttons, menus, form labels |
| **700 (Bold)** | Section titles, emphasis text, CTA elements |
| **900 (Black)** | Major headings, hero titles, strong emphasis |

### **Usage Guidelines**

- Use **Work Sans** for all heading levels (`h1`–`h4`) and for components requiring strong visual hierarchy.  
- Use **Noto Sans** for readable body content, form inputs, and small text elements.  
- Maintain consistency by avoiding mixed fonts within the same component.  
- Limit the use of **900 weight** to hero sections or major headings to avoid visual clutter.  
- For accessibility, ensure text contrast follows WCAG guidelines.

This structured typography system ensures clarity, usability, and consistency across the entire application UI.
